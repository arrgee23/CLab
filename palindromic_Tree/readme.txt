This is an implementation and few examples of use of palindromic trees.

the implementation and header files are eertree.c and eertree.h respectively.

prog1.c, prog2.c, prog3.c, prog4.c are the files that soves the following problems Respectively
a) Finding the number of subpalindromes, common to all k given strings.
(b) Finding the longest subpalindrome contained in all k given strings.
(c) For the strings S and T, finding the number of palindromes P having more occurrences
in S than in T.
(d) For the strings S and T, finding the number of equal palindromes, i.e., of triples (i, j, k)
such that S[i..i + k] = T[j..j + k] is a palindrome.
